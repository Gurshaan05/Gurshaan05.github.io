My name is Gurshaan Bassi. I attended Middletown High School before arriving to RIT, which is about a 4 hour drive from here. My main hobby is playing video games as it helps me relax and de-stress. A little fun fact about me is that I'm double jointed in all of my fingers. My favorite food to eat are sandwiches, but more specifically a sub (from Subway).

What I want to learn from the course is:

  <li>Useful strategies for working in the SE field</li>
  <li>How co-ops and internships work</li>
</ol>
